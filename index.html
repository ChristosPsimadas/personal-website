              <h1>Welcome</h1>
              
              <p>My name is Christos Psimadas and I am a Computer Science student at Stony Brook University. I have been passionate about Game Development ever since 
                I learned my first programming language in high school. The first game I ever made was a text-based Python game that I made in high school, and ever since then 
                Iâ€™ve been creating games that are more and more ambitious. </p>
              <p>My ultimate dream with game development is to share my thoughts and ideas with people in a way that would make them treasure the experience they had playing my game
                 by having fun gameplay as well as by telling a memorable story. </p>
              <p>Apart from game development, I would love to explore fields such as embedded systems and computer graphics as the idea of working close to the metal of a computer 
                excites me in the way that performing complex optimizations in game development does</p>
